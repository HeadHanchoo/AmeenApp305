Ameen App 🧕🇸🇦
This is my final project for CPIT 305. It’s a simple Java desktop app I built to help elderly users in Saudi Arabia do basic stuff like check their ID on Tawakkalna, see car violations on Absher, or transfer money on SNB. I wanted it to be as easy as possible, so it has visual guides and even voice support.


🎯 Key Features:
- Simple and clean UI using Java Swing
- 🔊 Voice-to-text  and Text-to-Voice support using PowerShell
- 💬 Real-time AI responses via OpenAI's API
- 📖 Visual step-by-step guides for key services
- ❓ FAQ search with built-in database
- 🌓 Light/Dark mode toggle with FlatLaf
- 🔠 Adjustable text size for accessibility
- 💾 Memory: Remembers user's name, ID, and age locally
- 🧠 Persistent chat memory and system instructions
- 🗃️ SQLite database integration for FAQs

## 🧪 What I Used:
- Java Swing (GUI)
- FlatLaf (Modern Look & Feel)
- OpenAI API (Language Model)
- PowerShell (Voice input/output)
- SQLite (FAQ database)
- Maven (to manage everything)
- JUnit (I added test cases for the database)


- 📁 File Structure

- `Main.java` – Main app logic and UI
- `GuideViewer.java` – App visual guides (e.g., SNB, Absher)
- `FAQViewer.java` – FAQ window and search
- `DatabaseManager.java` – SQLite integration
- `assets/` – Logos, UI icons, and guide images
- `speech.ps1` – Powershell script for voice-to-text
- `memory.json` – Stores user-specific info

- so now am gonna show you The Running Project:
